Here we will encounter binary security issues, so we need to code sign and notarize our binary to pass macOS’s Gatekeeper check. The development directory of the Alfred workflow needs to be symbolic link to Alfred.alfredpreferences, so that our workflow can communicate with Alfred.

Although this was said to be an deep dive session on Skaffold 2, we surveyed the audience about their use of Skaffold. Most of the people who attended the conference had not used it beyond that. The questions asked focused on the underlying technology used by Skaffold 2, such as the way containers are built via buildpack rather than `Dockerfile’, applicability，barriers to entry and the role of Skaffold in CI/CD, etc. These are actually good questions to ask. Skaffold is a developer-centric tool designed to enable developers to quickly develop, test, and deploy applications on Kubernetes. The pipeline phase is flexible and can be chosen according to your preferences and scenarios. For example, I personally prefer to use buildpack instead of Dockerfile, but what if I’m dealing with a non-mainstream scenario? In that case, you can still choose to use Dockerfile to build containers with full autonomy and control.

For instance. Cloud Workstation has alredy integrate with Cloud Code, basically it’s a plugin for VSCode with few cli tool like gcloud, skaffold but helm. Therefore, we could use Dockerfile to build our own image with helm. In this way, we could use helm in Cloud Workstation container base on our own image.

We could get same development experience as local workstation base on pre defined Jetrain base container image with JetBrains Gateway but few knows issues still not support for now. Debug on Kubernetes Debug a locally running Cloud Run service Finally, due to Cloud Workstation is preview version now, all of them are subject to change.

We first need to have some understanding of Google App Engine. Make sure our ideas work. Google App Engine is a Pass (Platform as a Service) service, which means we only need to focus on application development. So we can reuse gokit-todo, gokit-todo-frontend source code and deploy to Google App Engine through app.yaml configuration ✅ Google App Engine support standard-runtime (Python, Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, Go) and flexible-runtime (Go, Java 8, PHP 5/7, Python 2.7/3.6, .NET, Node.js, Ruby, Custom runtime) Choose standard runtime Go 1.16 for gokit-todo as it is a pure backend API microservice ✅ Chosee standard-runtime Node.js 16 for gokit-todo-frontentd as it is React frontend application ✅ We can choose Cloud SQL (Postgres) as our database to gokit-todo application in Google App Engine environment. You must use Cloud SQL proxy postgres driver cloudsqlpostgres to connect to Cloud SQL cause Cloud SQL will handle the connection authentication and authorization automatically. ✅ We can choose Google Cloud Build to handle CI/CD pipeline workflow and fully integrate with Github repo. There is most important things is you need to grant project default Google Cloud service account project-number@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com with enough permissions to build and deploy your application. ✅ Architecture Above is the whole architecture of our application gokit-todo-gae leverage with gokit-todo and gokit-todo-frontend as git submodule.

A buildpack is software that partially or completely transforms application source code into runnable artifacts. A lifecycle is software that orchestrates buildpacks and transforms the resulting artifacts into an OCI image. A platform is software that orchestrates a lifecycle to make buildpack functionality available to end-users such as application developers. 總的來說，buildpack 的目的是建立一個通用的規範， builder (Google, Heroku, Paketo) 除了實作這個規範之外也會增加一些功能來支援自己的產品(如 Google 的 gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:v1 builder 就有支援 Google Cloud function)。一般的情況就是選擇一個自己適合的 builder 直接使用 # Examples: pack build test_img --path apps/test-app --builder cnbs/sample-builder:bionic 當有特別的需求是可以自定義 buildpack 來完成，但開發者也必需依照同樣的規範的來實作自己的 buildpack；也因為 buildpack 需要按照規範來寫，不像 Dockerfile 這樣可以隨便寫(誤)，入門會有一點門檻，但是效益上會體現在如 container image 的安全性，大量產出 container image 的 CI/CD 流程上 聽起來好像很方便又覺得那邊卡卡的，我來說說一些心得 Pros 不用寫 Dcokerfile 一般的情況可以無惱的使用，可以把精力放在商業邏輯上 container image 的安性性由 builder 幫你處理 CI/CD 流程的整合: skaffold, cloud build, tekton 都有支援 Cons 因為要尊循規範, 自定義的入門門檻還是有一些 無惱 build container image 看似很美好，遇到 builder (Google, Heroku, Paketo) 不提供的部份就會很難受(踩到的坑後面再說) 如果想 build 出 container image size 小的部份得看 builder 有沒有支援，(如: paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny) ","date":"2021-04-02","objectID":"/posts/buildpack-tips-and-tricks/:0:1","tags":["buildpacks","gcp","pack","heroku","paketo"],"title":"Buildpack Tips and Tricks","uri":"/posts/buildpack-tips-and-tricks/"},{"categories":null,"content":"坑 現在來談談最近遇到的坑，先來看看現在 pack 建議的 builders，有 Google、Heroku 和 Paketo 三個，使用者可以跟據自己的需求選擇適合的 builder pack builder suggest Suggested builders: Google: gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:v1 Ubuntu 18 base image with buildpacks for .NET, Go, Java, Node.js, and Python Heroku: heroku/buildpacks:18 Base builder for Heroku-18 stack, based on ubuntu:18.04 base image Heroku: heroku/buildpacks:20 Base builder for Heroku-20 stack, based on ubuntu:20.04 base image Paketo Buildpacks: paketobuildpacks/builder:base Ubuntu bionic base image with buildpacks for Java, .NET Core, NodeJS, Go, Ruby, NGINX and Procfile Paketo Buildpacks: paketobuildpacks/builder:full Ubuntu bionic base image with buildpacks for Java, .NET Core, NodeJS, Go, PHP, Ruby, Apache HTTPD, NGINX and Procfile Paketo Buildpacks: paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny Tiny base image (bionic build image, distroless-like run image) with buildpacks for Java Native Image and Go 坑1 paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny 目前不支持 golang module 中使用 private repo fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled Confirm the import path was entered correctly.

makefile 整個專案的檔案架構如上，可以分為 endpoints、frontend、ownership 三個 Service(Module), 而 Google App Engine 可以非常有彈性的透過 Service1 的方式針對不同的任務給予不同資源2，而 Cage \u0026 Ping wedding 基本上使用預計的部份就足夠了，不需特別指派 dispatch.yaml dispatch: - url: \"*/_ah/spi/*\" module: default - url: \"*/tasks/*\" module: default - url: \"*/favicon.ico\" module: frontend - url: \"*/googleae8f4bcce8bec00c.html\" module: ownership - url: \"*/*\" module: frontend 上述的 dispatch.yaml 可以幫我們重導流量至我們設定的 Service(Module)，不過在部署的部份則是需要一個一個 Service(Module)來進行部署，部署完之後會在 Google App Engine Services 中看到所有的 Services 再則我們可以透過 version3 的方式來管理部署的 Service 當 Google App Engine Service 切分的越細，雖然可以任務的資源給予更細的調整，不過卻也造成部署上的複雜度，因此可以透過 mikefile 來加速部署的流程與速度 makefile ACCOUNT = cage.chung@gmail.com PROJECT = weddingcnp VERSION = b7484dd NODE_BIN = $(shell npm bin)

standard runtime 來作為網站的服務器，選擇使用吃資源較少的 golang，機器平均開機後的記憶體大約 200-300 MB, 效能比 Python 的好太多了 使用 dispatch.yaml 來進行服務的切分，將 endpoint API 的部份導至另外的 instance 作處理 2. weddingcnp 前端頁面設計實作 前端使用 echo 框架搭配 template 來產出頁面 3. weddingcnp endpointAPI 設計實作 利用 dispatch.yaml 來指定 endpoint API 實作的 Service，這邊基本 endpoint API 熟悉度使用 Python 版本，service 的另一個好處是可以再同一個專案下使用混合的語言來發開，這兒的例子是前端使用 golang, endpoint API 的部份使用 Python，搭配 Flexible 的環境也可以的，彈性非常的高 4. weddingcnp 前端 vue.js 設計實作 本來是打算使用 react.js 來實作前端，不過太花時間了，所以選擇了 vue.js 來快速實作出介接 endpoint API 前端的表單 5. weddingcnp edm 寄送 sendgrid 在收集到名單時，可以發通知給朋友。這兒的例子是我們的婚紗照片上線時，就發了 EDM 通知告訴朋友快點上來看。使用的是 sendgrid 來發信，透過 sendgrid 的模版、client API 讓發 html 的 EDM 輕鬆多了 weddingcnp 系例傳送門 weddingcnp via GCP 簡介 weddingcnp via GCP - 1. 專案架構切分 weddingcnp via GCP - 2. 前端頁面設計實作 weddingcnp via GCP -

因為 react-redux-starter-kit 也使用 webpack 進行程式碼的打包, 所以最後的產出預設在 dist 資料夾中，所以部署時只需要一個簡單的 host server 即可 # dist example $ l total 752 -rw-r--r-- 1 cage staff 3317 Aug 4 00:22

http.FileServer(http.Dir(\"./\")) 來 host 整個靜態目錄 package main import ( \"log\" \"net/http\" ) func main() { log.Println(\"Listening port 3000...\") log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\":3000\", http.FileServer(http.Dir(\"./\")))) } 但是上述的作法基本上是可以動的, 不過如果前端自己有使用到 redux-router 時, golang 並不會將請求導至前端的 router 而是直接得到 golang 404 而不會進到前端 redux-router 訂定的 router (如果有使用 redux-router 對 Notfound 進行處理) http://localhost:3000/dfa 所以我們使用了 golang echo 的 web framework, 監聽所有的請求並直接導至 index.html 的前端靜態檔案 package main import ( \"flag\" \"fmt\" \"net/http\" \"os\" \"strings\" \"github.com/labstack/echo\" \"github.com/labstack/echo/engine/standard\" mw \"github.com/labstack/echo/middleware\" ) const ( wwwRoot = \"./\" ) var ( httpPort = flag.Int(\"http\", 3000, \"http port number\") ) func Init()

作為一種新興的虛擬化方式，Docker 跟傳統的虛擬化方式相比具有眾多的優勢。 首先，Docker 容器的啟動可以在秒級實作，這相比傳統的虛擬機方式要快得多。 其次，Docker 對系統資源的使用率很高，一台主機上可以同時執行數千個 Docker 容器。 容器除了執行其中應用外，基本不消耗額外的系統資源，使得應用的效能很高，同時系統資源消耗更少。傳統虛擬機方式執行 10 個不同的應用就要啟動 10 個虛擬機，而 Docker 只需要啟動 10 個隔離的應用即可。 具體說來，Docker 在以下幾個方面具有較大的優勢。 更快速的交付和部署 對開發和維運（DevOps）人員來說，最希望的就是一次建立或設定，可以在任意地方正常執行。 開發者可以使用一個標準的映像檔來建立一套開發容器，開發完成之後，維運人員可以直接使用這個容器來部署程式碼。 Docker 可以快速建立容器，快速迭代應用程式，並讓整個過程全程可見，使團隊中的其他成員更容易理解應用程式是如何建立和工作的。 Docker 容器很輕很快！容器的啟動時間是秒級的，大量地節約開發、測試、部署的時間。 更有效率的虛擬化 Docker 容器的執行不需要額外的虛擬化支援，它是核心層級的虛擬化，因此可以實作更高的效能和效率。 更輕鬆的遷移和擴展 Docker 容器幾乎可以在任意的平台上執行，包括實體機器、虛擬機、公有雲、私有雲、個人電腦、伺服器等。 這種兼容性可以讓使用者把一個應用程式從一個平台直接遷移到另外一個。 更簡單的管理 使用 Docker，只需要小小的修改，就可以替代以往大量的更新工作。所有的修改都以增量的方式被分發和更新，從而實作自動化並且有效率的管理。 擷錄於 為什麼要用 Docker | 《Docker —— 從入門到實踐 》正體中文版 ","date":"2015-09-30","objectID":"/posts/managed-vms-lab/:1:1","tags":["Golang","GAE","Python","Managed-VMs"],"title":"Managed VMs lab","uri":"/posts/managed-vms-lab/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Managed VMs App Engine + Docker = Managed VMs App Engine 是 Google 一個 PasS 的服務，完全受 Google 管理及控制，開發者只需要專注於 Data 及 Application 的發開。 Docker 則是一個新興的 container 技術，讓發開者可以更快速的交付和部署、更有效率的虛擬化、更輕鬆的遷移和擴展、更簡單的管理。 Why Managed VMs?
